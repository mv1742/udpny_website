  		Exploring Gentrification and Displacement Through User-Generated Geographic Information
			<br>
  		<p style="margin-top: 50px">
  		Gentrification and displacement are pressing issues for many cities today, as urban populations continue to grow and neighborhoods change rapidly in response. Our Capstone study utilizes two such novel data sources, Twitter and Foursquare, to explore gentrification and displacement risk for neighborhoods within the 31-county NY metro region. Using methodology established by the UC Berkeley Urban Displacement Project, we utilize both administrative census data and user-generated social media data, to model the gentrification phenomena and in changing neighborhoods.

				<h3>Data Exploration</h3>
				<p>
					An initial round of exploratory analysis was done on the datasets to gain an understanding of the profile of the data, distribution of the data across our target geography, and identify attributes of the data that can be feature engineered to include into our models.
Foursquare data was initially clustered by income level.
Similarly, Twitter data was clustered using several different metric combinations.

				</p>
				<h3>Data Modeling</h3>
				<p>
					The initial round of models focused on attempting to model the spectrum of gentrification, using multiclass classification to predict all eight gentrification typologies in the original UDP index.
Based on these results, we re-evaluated the modeling approach of the project through additional literature review and feedback from our project sponsor/mentor. Two major changes were done to address the poor performance of the models. First, we shifted from a multiclass classification approach to a binary classification approach
Second, we started to delve into different metrics of gentrification, namely the distinction between people gentrification, place gentrification, and hybrid gentrification approaches.

				<p>
					Through coordination with our project sponsor, weâ€™ve identified three different available online data sources to act as proxies for human activity across three different domains: Twitter for mobility, Zillow for housing, and Foursquare for businesses. These distinct sources will be used to evaluate whether or such generated data can help us improve our understanding of more granular gentrification patterns and activity in changing neighborhoods.

				<h3>Foursquare Data Results</h3>
				<p>
					During the data exploration phase, several findings around business type stood out as significant. For example, donut shops and fast food restaurants made up a significantly larger proportion of business in low income neighborhoods than in high income areas. Additionally, the presence of coffee shops and Italian restaurants was noticeably larger in high income areas.
          <br><br>Upon further exploration, we were also able to identify some business types which made up larger shares of gentrifying areas, such as Sandwich Places and Mexican Restaurants. The Foursquare data also highlighted interesting trends as you moved along the spectrum of gentrifying typologies-- for example, an increase in coffee shops and bars with further gentrification. As a last portion of our exploratory

analysis, we examined the Foursquare data classes (necessary, optional) and categories (nutrition, social, consumption). Looking across the phases of gentrification, we again see a trend-- decreasing percentage of necessary businesses, with increasing optional businesses and decreasing nutritional percentage with increasing social businesses.

				</p>
				<h3>Twitter Data Results</h3>
				<p>
					The Twitter clustering based on percentages revealed 5 distinct profiles of neighborhood Twitter activity, with the majority of census tracts falling in locally dominated clusters 0 and 2. Clusters 1 and 4 show unique activity patterns with a predominance of visitor and neighbor tweets respectively.
					Comparing these results to the typologies unveiled that most tracts associated with gentrifying neighborhoods have predominantly local tweets, with increasing visitor tweets as they move towards exclusion. Further digging revealed at risk tracts within clusters 1 and 4 show different median income
and percentage rent levels than at risk neighborhoods in other clusters.
<br><br>In general, model performance is poor across all four. Twitter models did not show improvement with the inclusion of population data, but improved considerably with the addition of income data as expected. Based on a study by Chapple et. al (2019), we expect visitor tweet behavior and demographics to provide even better insights into behavior and modelling. The addition of this data and exploration of anomalies discussed above should reveal more interesting features for use in our models.

				</p>
				<h3>Result Discussion</h3>
				<p>

					<br><br>The additional features using population and income improved the performance of the Foursquare data. From our data exploration, it was evident that businesses per population and income provide insights about the neighborhoods studied. The accuracy improved from 0.280 for model 1.1 to 0.357 for model 1.3 (see table 5). On the other hand, as expected, Twitter models didnâ€™t improve with population given early exploration showed no correlation between these features and volume of tweets.
<br><br>Appendix C shows the distribution of typology types. It can be seen that even a model with a strong prior that assumes all neighborhoods to be classified as MHI - Stable or Early Stage of Exclusion, which represents 0.37 of total typologies, can have a stronger performance than our base model that obtained 0.28 accuracy only. Similarly, the best performing model using Foursquare data on binary classes (gentrified and not gentrified) has an out of sample accuracy of 0.70, while the largest class (0 - â€˜No Gentrificationâ€™) represents 0.72 of the total two classesâ€‹.
In order to improve our results performance, we must continue to improve our features. We will extract Shannon-Wiener Index of complexity of activities as well as gravity and centrality indexes to better

describe experiential qualities of public spaces and development opportunities of urban spaces and neighborhoods. In addition, in order to learn from the effects of the neighboring Census Tracts, we will map the average census tract and user generated data features spatial lag deciles (the average of the values for the neighbouring regions) using queen's weights (Anselin, Rey & Li 2014).
